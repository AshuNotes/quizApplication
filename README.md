## üß† How It Works

1. **Questions** are defined in `questions.js` as a JavaScript array.
2. `quiz.js` handles the quiz logic:
   - Loads each question and options dynamically.
   - Captures user input and checks answers.
   - Tracks score and displays final result.
3. The user interface is updated in real-time based on user interaction.
4. Clean styling provided in `style.css` to ensure readability and responsiveness.
